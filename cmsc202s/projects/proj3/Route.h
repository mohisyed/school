  // Postconditions: Creates a new Route where m_head and m_tail point to nullptr and size = 0

  // Preconditions: None
  // Postconditions: Sets name of route

  // Name: ~Route() - Destructor
  // Desc: Used to destruct a strand of Route
  // Preconditions: There is an existing Route strand with at least one port
  // Postconditions: Route is deallocated (including all dynamically allocated ports)
  //                 to have no memory leaks!

  //                Requires a Route
  // Postconditions: Adds the new port to the end of a route

  // Name: RemovePort(int index)
  // Desc: Removes a port from the route at the index provided
  //       Hint: Special cases (first port, last port, middle port)
  // Preconditions: Index must be less than the size of the route
  //       Cannot make route less than two ports. If the route has
  //       two or fewer ports, fails.
  // Postconditions: Name may be updated. Size is reduced. Route has one less port.

  // Preconditions: Requires a Route
  // Postconditions: Returns m_name;

  // Desc: Returns the number of ports in a route
  // Preconditions: Requires a Route

  // Desc: Reverses a route
  // Preconditions: Reverses the Route
  // Postconditions: Route is reversed in place; nothing returned
